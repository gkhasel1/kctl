IMPROVEMENTS
=============
 - radio/checkbox label align
 - better validation of registration forms (emails, phone numbers, etc.)
 - use reg to populate attendance (right now uses user season, program, site fields...)
 - season and court data as fixtures?

 - make it possible to edit all data directly on the data page with a special password
 - password protect the website
 - icons for season, program, site

 - student surveys/homework?

 - NOTE: when someone reregisters we will have to set the `court` in the student/volunteer record to have them populate in attendance
