IMPROVEMENTS
=============
 - radio/checkbox label align
 - better validation of registration forms (emails, phone numbers, etc.)
 - get rid of hardcoded CURRENT_SEASON value
 - use reg to populate attendance (right now uses user court field...)
 - need some kind of start new season button that resets student.court and CURRENT_SEASON etc.
 - hide the management buttons (attendance, data, roster, edit person etc.) unless a password is entered on the options page
 - season and court data as fixtures?
 - student surveys/homework?

 - [!!!!!!!!!!!!!] Split reg into creating new Student/Volunteer then setting up a registration record? Would make it easier for returning registrations?
